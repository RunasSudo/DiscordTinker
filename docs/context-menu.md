Some existing BetterDiscord scripts seem to rely on the existence of a `MessageContextMenu` React component, but I was unable to reproduce this. In my testing, the context menu is handled by a `Popout` React component, with a `OptionPopout` child. Within the rendered output of `OptionPopout` is a number of `div.btn-item`s, for each context menu item. Oddly, however, these `div`s are not React elements.

Examining `OptionPopout.prototype.render`, we find a number of React-element-like objects being generated by an `r` function (e.g. `r("div", { className: "btn-item", onClick: this.handleRetry }, undefined, "Retry")`. The final return value is another call to `r`, `r("div", { className: "option-popout small-popout-box" }, undefined, item1, item2, item3, ...)`.

This `r` function is somewhat similar in behaviour to `React.createElement`, but does not call that function and hence is not patched by our naive treatment of `createElement`. Extracting the code for this function requires a little finesse, but the function itself is simple, taking the form `r(type, props, key, children...)` and returning `{ $$typeof: Symbol.for('react.element'), type: ..., key: ..., ref: null, props: ..., _owner: null }`.

With this knowledge, we can simply monkey-patch the `OptionPopout.prototype.render` function to append our own React-element-like object to the `props.children` of the native result.
